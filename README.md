# Account-Management-System-Corrected
Broke the last project, ported to a new one and fixed everything :)

Basic management system using Java and SQLite.

Features:

-Add and remove your account

-Username and password validation (no one letter usernames :))

-SHA256 encrypted passwords

-Different user roles, admins have the ability to quickly add/delete bot accounts for testing
